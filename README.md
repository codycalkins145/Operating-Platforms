# Operating-Platforms
  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The client, The Gaming Room, is the developer of the Draw It or Lose It Android app. The client requested that we 
    assist in the development of a web-based version of their app in order to serve multiple operating platforms. The 
    client requested that the program be developed with these specific requirements:
        •	A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
        •	Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
        •	Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
        •	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating 
           unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
  
  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  
     I'd say I did the best on describing the Domain Model during the development of this documentation. I had a fairly 
     easy time in understanding the structure and the meaning of the UML diagram provided. 
     
  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
     When developing the code, I found reviewing the given UML diagram to be the most helpful aspect of the design 
     document. This gave me clear relationships between each class and how each class should function together.
     
  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     
     If I were to revise one part of these documents, it would be the Evaluation section of the design document. I would
     likely add more detail to some descriptions and improve the accuracy of each description as necessary.
     
  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
     In implementing the user's needs into the software design, I ensured that they were included in the summary of the 
     design and in the words of the client as interpretation was straightforward. The user's needs are important when 
     designing the software because they are the ones who will be using the program the most. If the user doesn't enjoy
     using a program or something doesn't meet their expectations, they'll be less likely to use and enjoy using it.
     
  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
     In designing this software, I tried my best to understand the important functions that made it work. Doing this 
     allowed me to implement and understand necessary code when finishing the software. In the future, I would likely
     continue to use this strategy as well as use relevant examples from past software that I've created or helped create.
